# Writing Good Commit Messages

By writing good commits, you are simply future-proofing yourself. You could save yourself and/or coworkers hours of digging around while 
troubleshooting by providing that helpful description. <br/><br/>The extra time it takes to write a thoughtful commit message as a letter to your 
potential future self is extremely worthwhile. On large scale projects, documentation is imperative for maintenance.

## 5 Steps to Write Better Commit Messages
1. **Capitalization and Punctuation:** Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation.
2. **Mood:** Use imperative mood in the subject line. Example - ```Add fix for dark mode toggle state```. Imperative mood gives the tone you are giving an order or request.
3. **Type of Commit:** Specify the type of commit. It is recommended and can be even more beneficial to have a consistent set of words to describe your changes. Example: Bugfix, Update, Refactor, Bump, and so on.
4. **Length:** The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characthers, and the body should be restricted to 72 characters.
5. **Content:** Be direct, try to eliminate filler words and phrases in these sentences.
