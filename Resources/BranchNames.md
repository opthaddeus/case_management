# Writing Good Branch Names
A branching strategy is a convention or a set of rules that specify when branches get created. 

It helps teams and developers by describing the naming guidelines of branches and elaborates on what use the branches should have, and so on.

With a lack of appropriate naming conventions, the code maintenance team suffers numerous confusions and complications.

Git branching naming convention supports the organic growth of a codebase in a systematic way. It helps in separating the work strategically.

## The best practices of the Git branch naming convention
### 1. Starting branch name with a category word: 
One of the best methods to improve efficiency is by adding a word that categorizes the branch. The general idea is to use short words. The word selection could be anything that suits your working system.

Use category words such as:
```
WIP - Work in progress and needs your attention.
Bug - A bug or an error that needs fixing promptly.
With the help of the category word, it is effortless to identify the purpose of the Git branch and attend to it.
```
### 2. Using hyphen or slash separators:
The preference between a hyphen, slash, or underscore separator is based on you and your team's choice. The idea is to keep it tightly consistent.

Without the separators, the names become more challenging to read, creating confusion for the team. 
Using separators such as underscores, you can improve the readability and make the name more comfortable to manage.

Separators are especially more significant if you are dealing with a vast number of branches.

### 3. Using author name in Git branch
Numerous companies use this technique of adding the author's name to the branch names.
This method helps to track the work of different developers. With further requirements, progressive additions are also possible.
```
Example - name_feature_new-experimental-changes
```
### 4. Avoid using just numerals
Using only numbers in the branch name's issue ID can lead to more confusion for the team.
Such confusion during the merging process of Git branches may lead to a lot of mistakes.

### 5. Avoid simultaneous naming convention
Blending or combining Git branch naming conventions only leads to complications and makes the process prone to errors. Consistency is a critical aspect, and the team should maintain the decided conventions.

### 6. Avoid long names

Precision is the crucial regard of Git branch naming. The name needs to be informative and short.
