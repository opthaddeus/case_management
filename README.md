## Guidelines
### Before working on the application, please follow these steps below:
#### 1. When working on the project, clone the GitHub repository in your favorite IDE or Text Editor by using this command in the terminal: <br />
```
git clone <url>
``` 
#### 2. In your teminal, create a new branch with this command. The command simultaneously creates and checks out ＜new-branch＞. 
The -b option is a convenience flag that tells Git to run git branch before running git checkout ＜new-branch＞.
```
git checkout -b <new-branch> 
``` 
#### 3. Once you have changed or added a new feature you can use this command to capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes:
```
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Commit Message"
```
#### 4. Lastly, to push all of your commits to the GitHub repository, you can use this command:
```
git push
```
